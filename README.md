### Key Steps:  

1. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**:  
   - Addressed missing values using imputation methods (mean, median, or mode imputation depending on the column type).  
   - Standardized inconsistent data entries for uniformity.  
   - Detected and removed outliers using statistical techniques such as Z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), and boxplots.  
   - Removed unnecessary columns to reduce noise and improve model performance.  
   - Encoded categorical variables and transformed features for better usability in machine learning models.  

2. **Data Visualization**:  
   - Explored relationships between key features like condition, mileage, and market prices using heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts.  
   - Leveraged Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in the dataset.  

3. **Machine Learning Model Implementation**:  
   - Developed and evaluated a range of models, including:  
     - **Polynomial Regression**: To model non-linear relationships.  
     - **Random Forests**: For robust predictions and feature importance analysis.  
     - **XGBoost**: High-performance gradient boosting for precise predictions.  
     - **Ensemble Models**: Combined outputs from multiple algorithms to enhance accuracy and reduce bias/variance.  

4. **Model Optimization and Evaluation**:  
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search and random search methods.  
   - Used cross-validation techniques to validate model performance and prevent overfitting.  
   - Assessed models using evaluation metrics like RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
